# Australian nightlife and its regulation and policing

This work is in support of a UNSW research project into Australian nightlife and its regulation and policing.

A key challenge in parts of Australia is the high concentration of people in a few nightlife districts. This 
creates a range of social and health issues from noise and loss of amenity; to overburdened transport and 
hospitals; to violence, injury and even death. 

This research is looking to measure concentration, density and dispersion in different nightlife districts
across Australia. We will use insights from this data to inform the public debate on nightlife policy and 
regulation with the objective of minimising harm while enabling a thriving nightlife. 

If you have data sources that can enable this research, or you would like to discuss any of my work please 
feel free to contact me.
